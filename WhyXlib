WHY XLIB

Let us not forget the reason we delve into Xlib the way we did. Having not known low-level 
Xlib it comforted me but also consumed me. I need to stick to the very explict goal to make
it through this.

The Goal: Remotoe GUI's. This is for DistroWorlds Ideas. 
I need some way to remotley do a virtual machine from anywhere.
From the web, from a windows computer. A way to login to any Linux 
distribution from anywhere. The concept goes further, this idea I 
have in the back of my head is Social Hacking. Now, I'm talking about
social engieering, I'm actually describing an enviorment where you 
can go and just hack one another. Some may get points for setting flags,
were others score by getting them flags. Your given a virtual system. Now,
secure it and don't get hacked.

LEADER -
   The persons machine that hasnt been penatrated and has a secure virtual machine.
   But at the same-time has exploited a high percentage of machines.
